|Topic|NLog|Serilog

|Conclusion
a|- easy setup
- for my usecase: same logfile-output (text, json, structured, whatever)

- NLog took me ; Serilog took me 3 hours
a|- theoratically good
- poor exprience in reality, mainly because of the bad documentation
- pretty complicated setup, if the defaults don't fullfill your needs (due to bad docs)
- headaches and cumbersome digging in docs, sourcecode, github issues

|Time to setup loggin in a new app wiht specific demands.
For me: log to file & console. With classname, Exceptions and some structured data.
|20 Minutes
|200 Minutes

|Documentation
a|- very extensive
- well structured
- working examples

a|- few docs
- outdated
- examples do not work as described
- "documentation" is mostly in github isses, when people ask how things work
- there's no clear statement what the ":l" modifier in the format template does; it 

|include Class-Name in log output
a|- create a field with `ILogger _log = LogManager.GetCurrentClassLogger();`
- you are done! Default target-layout contains the appropriate 
- it will appear in File an Console-log
a|- create a field with `ILogger _log = Log.ForContext<MqttDrainService>();`
- add `{SourceContext}` to outputTemplate
- for console: `[{Timestamp:HH:mm:ss} {Level:u3} {SourceContext}] {Message:j}{NewLine}{Exception}`
- add `.Enrich.FromLogContext()` to Configuration

|Hints
a|- config file
- put an nlog.config in the root of your project
- set `CopyToOutputDirectory` for nlog.config to `Always`
- copy paste a basic config into you nlog.config https://github.com/nlog/nlog/wiki/Configuration-file#nlog-config-xml
a|- remove the ":l" modifier to automatically add quotes for strings
