|SVM
|support-vector machine
|a vector separating the datapoints in a binary(two-class) system, support-vectors describe nearest Point from the separator between the two classes.

|Kernel
|"function" given to the SVM, describing the mapping for the feature vectors in a higher dimension
a|can be:

* linear
* RBF (gaussian radial basis function)
* Polynomial
* CosineSimilarity
* Fourier
* Spline

|ECOC
|"error correcting output codes" or "(Error-Correcting) Output-Code multiclass strategy"
|smart combination of a set of SVMs. For 5 classes train 5*5 SVMs. Every class has at least 5 SVMs of which n-1 must match the prediction.

|SDCA
|Stochastic dual coordinate ascent
|?

|LR
|linear regression
