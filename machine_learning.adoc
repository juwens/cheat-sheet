|SVM
|support-vector machine
|a vector separating the datapoints in a binary(two-class) system, support vectors describe the margin between the two classes.

|Kernel
|"function" of the SVM describing the hyperplane between the two classes
a|can be 
* linear
* RBF (Radial basis function)
* Polynomial
* CosineSimilarity
* Fourier
* Spline

|ECOC
|"error correcting output codes" or "(Error-Correcting) Output-Code multiclass strategy"
|smart combination of a set of SVMs. For 5 classes train 5*5 SVMs. Every class has at least 5 SVMs of which n-1 must match the prediction.

|SDCA
|Stochastic dual coordinate ascent
